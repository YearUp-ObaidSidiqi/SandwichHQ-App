# SandwichHQ - Point of Sale (POS) System

## Overview

**SandwichHQ** is a point of sale (POS) system designed for a sandwich shop. It allows users to create and customize sandwich orders, calculate the prices based on selected options, and generate detailed receipts. The system includes the following features:
- Sandwich customization (size, toppings, extra meat, cheese, etc.)
- Drink and chips ordering
- Dynamic receipt generation and file saving
- Displaying the receipt in a user-friendly interface

## Features

- **Sandwich Customization**: Choose the size, bread, meats, cheese, toppings, and sauces. Prices change depending on selected options.
- **Order Calculation**: Prices are dynamically calculated based on the sandwich size, toppings, extra meats, and cheese selections.
- **Drink and Chips Ordering**: A selection of drink sizes and chips are also available, with prices based on the size of the drink.
- **Receipt Generation**: After the checkout, a detailed receipt is shown to the user on the interface and saved as a text file.
- **User Interface (UI)**: The user interface is designed using Java Swing to allow easy ordering and viewing of receipts.

   - Includes a `receipt()` method to format the order details into a string for the receipt.

3. **HQ_UserInterface.java**:
   - Manages file saving and receipt generation.
   - The `createAndShowOrderReceipt()` method writes the receipt to a text file and displays it in the UI using a `JTextArea`.

4. **SandwichHQUI.java**:
   - The main UI for the SandwichHQ system.
   - Allows users to add items to their order, view the total, and checkout.
   - Displays the receipt in a scrollable text area and saves it to a file.

## Setup Instructions

     ```
     javac -d bin src/com/pluralsight/*.java
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
